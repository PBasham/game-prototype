# Decision log

Newest first. Each entry: what was decided, why, and what it affects.

## 2026-11-12: Project foundations

- **Engine:** Godot 4.7.2 stable, GDScript with static typing. Fast iteration, best docs,
  exports everywhere. 3.x is maintenance-only.
- **Platform:** PC, Steam release.
- **Multiplayer:** yes, later. Built host-authoritative from day one (docs/architecture.md)
  so it can be added without a rewrite.
- **Tile size:** 16 px (revisit before real art if needed).
- **World:** Terraria-like size presets, wrapping horizontally like Starbound.
- **Progression:** tiers unlocked by bosses; details later.
- **Death penalty:** like Terraria / Starbound (lose part of currency, keep items);
  harder modes later.
- **Hunger:** slow drain, Well Fed buff, starving deals light damage over time; can be
  turned off per world.
- **Characters and worlds:** saved separately.
- **Bosses:** summoned when conditions are met (item, biome, depth, time, area),
  defined per boss as data.
- **Testing:** GUT, run headless in GitHub Actions on every push.
